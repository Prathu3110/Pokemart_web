# PokéMart Website

A simple static website inspired by the PokéMart from the Pokémon games.

The site represents a basic PokéMart layout with a clean navigation bar, hero section, gallery, and contact section. It is designed to visually reflect the Pokémon theme while keeping the structure simple and easy to understand.

This project focuses on building a complete front-end website using only core web technologies and improving layout, styling, and overall presentation.
